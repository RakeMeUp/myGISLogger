### [LIVE SITE](https://jocular-pavlova-266a3c.netlify.app/)

# myGISLogger
I needed a way to efficiently log my work, so i created/creating this website for my own good.

## What it does
* The users copies a specific line from Excel or Google Sheets, pastes into the Datalog Page
* The site, after error checking, automatically divides, filters and stores the data
* Upon entering the Main page, data will be calculated and shown to the user.
* All in Client-side, cuz Netlify is free and I am broke.

## Tech used

* React (Vite) + TypeScript + Sass
* Jest + Vitest for Unit Testing

## Current Stage of the Website
About 20% Done.
